A golf stroke counter (or count anything up to 99) for the pebble smartwatch.

Current functionality:
  Count from 0 to 99
  Up button short press decrements count (if count is already at 0 it will remain at 0)
  Center button short press resets count to 0
  Down button short press increments count (if count is 99 it will reset to 0)

Potential future functionality:
  Track hole number
  Add second window with complete scorecard (accessed by long press of center button)
  Track hole score vs. par (develop preprocessor to allow course pars to be entered through web app)

Special thanks to DouweM for letting me use the number pngs from his PebbleRevolution watchface: https://github.com/DouweM/PebbleRevolution

Big thanks to all the #pebble folks on freenode for their help.
