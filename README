A golf stroke counter (or count anything up to 99) for the pebble smartwatch.

Current functionality:
  Count from 0 to 99
  Up button short press decrements count (if count is already at 0 it will remain at 0)
  Down button short press increments count (if count is 99 it will reset to 0)
  Center button short press resets count to 0, increments hole number (if less than 18), and adds hole score to total score

Potential future functionality:
  Add second window with complete scorecard (accessed by long press of center button)
  Add some sort of persistant storage (httpebble or other solution)

Special thanks to DouweM for letting me use the number pngs from his PebbleRevolution watchface: https://github.com/DouweM/PebbleRevolution

Big thanks to all the #pebble folks on freenode for their help.
